## Components vendored in this repository

### The waterbox (BizHawk) - MIT

The sandbox design and the bulk of the imported code come from the waterbox
subsystem of BizHawk (https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk), Copyright (c)
the BizHawk team and contributors, MIT License. This covers:

- `source/host/` - the sandbox host, a from-scratch C port of BizHawk's Rust
  `waterbox/waterboxhost`. (The Rust original was carried in this repo's early
  history as `runtime/` and has since been removed; it lives on in BizHawk.)
- `source/host/src/interop_bin.c` embeds `interop.bin` - the stack-switch blob
  assembled from BizHawk's `waterbox/waterboxhost/src/context/interop.s`.
- `extern/emulibc/` - the guest support library (ECL_* macros, allocators,
  `__wbxsysinfo`).
- `extern/libcxx/` - the LLVM sysroot build scripts (the scripts are
  BizHawk's; the libraries they build are LLVM's, see below).
- `source/guest/linkscript.T` - the guest link script (fixed base, waterbox sections).
- `extern/libco/amd64.c` - the waterbox-specific rewrite of libco's amd64
  backend (derived from byuu's libco, see below).
- `docs/Notes on Debugging.md`.

### musl libc - MIT (Rich Felker and contributors)

`extern/musl` is a **vendored** copy of a waterbox-retargeted fork of musl libc
(https://github.com/nattthebear/musl @ 2063abc4, forked from
https://musl.libc.org), Copyright (c) 2005-2020 Rich Felker and the musl
contributors, MIT License. The full text and complete author list are in that
tree's `COPYRIGHT` file. The waterbox-arch additions in the fork (the `waterbox`
architecture directory, the syscall trampoline glue) are contributed under the
same MIT terms.

It is vendored rather than tracked as a submodule because upstream is no longer
maintained (no divergence to reconcile), and miniBox carries one local fix
applied directly in the tree:

- `arch/waterbox/atomic_arch.h`: `a_inc`/`a_dec` were `*p++`/`*p--` (increment
  the POINTER and discard it) instead of `(*p)++`/`(*p)--`. Harmless
  single-threaded, but with multiple guest threads it corrupts musl's `vmlock`
  counter (decremented on every `__vm_unlock`, never incremented), so a guest
  that frees memory while multithreaded deadlocks in `__vm_wait`. Found by
  miniBox's threaded guest test. This bug is present in upstream waterbox musl
  and affects BizHawk's Rust host too.

### libco - public domain (byuu)

`extern/libco/libco.h` and the original libco design are by byuu (Near),
released into the public domain (see the header of each file: "license: public
domain"). `extern/libco/amd64.c` is the waterbox rewrite of the amd64 backend
(BizHawk, MIT), built on that public-domain base.

## Components fetched or built at build time (NOT vendored here)

### LLVM libc++ / libc++abi / libunwind / compiler-rt - Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM exception

`extern/libcxx/*.sh` sparse-clone the LLVM project
(https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) at a pinned tag and build the guest C++
standard library, unwinder, and compiler builtins. Those sources are Copyright
(c) the LLVM contributors, licensed Apache-2.0 with the LLVM exception. They are
downloaded during a guest toolchain build, not stored in this repository; the
license applies to the built guest artifacts.

### (Former) Rust crate dependencies

The early Rust reference (`runtime/`, now removed) depended on third-party
crates (bitflags, page_size, lazy_static, itertools, goblin, anyhow, sha2,
winapi/libc). The C port (`source/host/`) has NO external dependencies - SHA-256 and
ELF parsing are hand-written - so miniBox no longer pulls any crates.
