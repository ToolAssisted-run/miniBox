/* diag.c - saying what happened when the sandbox dies.
 *
 * A guest death is not like other bugs: there is no core dump to read, no
 * debugger attached, and often no console. On Windows the host is loaded into a
 * GUI process, so stderr goes precisely nowhere - which turns "the guest hit an
 * unimplemented syscall at frame 3" into "the emulator vanished", and the person
 * who could have fixed it in five minutes gets nothing to work from.
 *
 * So a FATAL diagnostic also goes to a file. Only fatal ones: this writes
 * nothing during a normal run, and the file appearing at all means something
 * died. MINIBOX_LOG names it; otherwise it lands beside the working directory as
 * minibox-diag.log.

/* ---- provenance ----
 * What this library was built from, for the frontend to show and a movie to record.
 * The whole emulation path is meant to be reproducible from what an artifact carries;
 * the host was the last part of it that could not say where it came from.
 *
 * The values arrive as compile-time defines because two build systems compile these
 * sources (miniBox's own, and miniHawk's, which lists them itself), and a define is
 * the one thing both can supply without sharing a generated file. Everything here is
 * a function of the inputs - no timestamps, no hostname, no paths - so that two
 * builds of one commit stay byte-identical.
